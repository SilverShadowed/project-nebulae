HOW TO USE:
1. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed 
2. run "plot.py", make sure that all python programs are in the same folder.

NOTE: the program requires you to enter the names of exoplanets EXACTLY how it's listed in the NASA exoplanet archive. A drop list feature and correct error handling will be made soon
